==Plot==
Ryuji Takasu is frustrated at trying to look his best as he enters his second year of high school. Despite his gentle personality, his eyes give him the appearance of an intimidating delinquent. He is happy to be classmates with his best friend Yusaku Kitamura, as well as the girl he has a crush on, Minori Kushieda. However, he unexpectedly runs into "the school's most dangerous animal of the highest risk level"—Taiga Aisaka—who just happens to be Minori's best friend. Taiga has a negative attitude towards others and has a habit of snapping violently at people. She takes an instant dislike to Ryuji, and it turns out she is living in an apartment facing Ryuji's house. When Ryuji discovers that Taiga has a crush on Yusaku, and Taiga finds out about Ryuji's affections towards Minori, they make an arrangement to help set each other up with their crushes.

Over the course of the series, Ryuji and Taiga try to set up romantic situations to help each other get to know their friends, but many of the situations backfire. Their classmates observe that they are spending a lot of time with each other, leading to rumors that they might be a couple. Although Ryuji and Taiga try to dispel the rumors, they find that they do enjoy each other's company, with Taiga visiting Ryuji's house to share meals, and Ryuji checking up on Taiga to get her to school, and cleaning for her. They meet Yusaku's childhood friend Ami Kawashima, a popular teen model who transfers into their school. She appears to be friendly and is a self-proclaimed ditz, but beneath her facade is a rather mean and spoiled brat, and she quickly finds herself at odds with Taiga. In spite of this, Taiga tries to put up with her antics as Yusaku wants them to all get along, and Ami begins to grow feelings for Ryuji. The series follows the lives of these friends and how love blossoms among them.

:The viewpoint character of the light novels, Ryuji is introduced as a second-year high school student with a mistaken reputation of being a delinquent because of his ''[[sanpaku]]'' (glaring) eyes. He lives with his single mother, his father having left before he was born. Because of this, Ryuji has learned to be self-sufficient: he cooks and cleans, the latter to the point of compulsively cleaning up any messes he can find.<ref name="nis staff"/> He has a pet [[parakeet]] named {{Nihongo|"Inko-chan"|インコ|Inko|lit. "parakeet"}} He has a longstanding crush on the cheerful and pretty classmate Minori Kushieda. After Ryuji meets Taiga Aisaka, he often helps her with domestic chores, and develops a new reputation as the "only person able to stop the Palmtop Tiger" as well as having to fend off rumors that the two might be a couple.{{Ref|Chapter|Vol. 1}} Although he does not have a romantic interest in Taiga, he determines he wants to look after her, help her out as much as possible, and to be friends with her.
:Due to the misunderstandings caused by his appearance, as well as his family situation, he tends to have low self-esteem. In spite of this, he is rather calm in most situations and is responsible, smart, and has great grades, even compared to Yusaku Kitamura, his best friend. In seeming contrast to his intimidating looks, Ryuji actually prefers avoiding serious conflicts and tends to put others first, to the point of losing sight of what he really wants in life.{{volume needed|date=May 2016}}
:In the light novels, he sees a tender side of Taiga that she hides from everyone.  In the anime, he is dense when it comes to girls' feelings, especially when it comes to Taiga, Minori, and Ami. While initially seen as intimidating by most, he still manages to make good friends. His relationship with Taiga begins to change as he spends more time with her throughout the series. Eventually, he falls in love with Taiga and they become a couple at the end of the series.

:The other title character of the series, Taiga is a girl in Ryuji's class. She has a beautiful appearance, but dislikes the company of others, with the exception of her best friend Minori Kushieda. Because of her tendency to snap fiercely at others, and because of her diminutive stature (4 feet 8 inches in manga, 4 feet 7 inches in anime), Taiga's nickname is {{Nihongo|"Palmtop Tiger"|手乗りタイガー|Te Nori Taigā}}. She often receives confessions of love from boys due to her cute, or as Ryuji puts it, "doll-like" appearance, but she turns down every single one. Despite her reputation, she is actually a clumsy girl who is very shy and awkward around her crush Kitamura.{{Ref|Chapter|Vol. 1}}<ref name="nis staff"/> Despite coming from a well-to-do family, her life with them was very difficult because of various problems. She lived with her father and step-mother and constantly fought with them,{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 5}} eventually moving out and living on her own. Having come from a privileged household, she does not know how to do any domestic chores. Upon meeting Ryuji and learning of his domestic talents, she relies on him to cook for her.{{Ref|Chapter|Vol. 1, 2}} Aside from sleeping in her own apartment and going to school, she spends most of her time at Ryuji's house, so much so that his mother considers her a member of the family.{{Ref|Chapter|Vol. 1}} Eventually she falls in love with Ryuji and they become a couple at the end of the series.

:Minori is a cheerful classmate who is Ryuji's crush and Taiga's best friend. She is captain of the girls' softball club.{{Ref|Chapter|Vol. 1}} She tends to be air-headed at times, although it is later revealed that she is very perceptive, being one of the few people to see Ryuji for the gentle person he is, and is also not fooled by Ami's facade.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 15}} When she hears rumors that Ryuji and Taiga are a couple, she pulls both of them aside and begs Ryuji to take good care of Taiga. She works many part-time jobs preferring to keep herself busy.{{Ref|Chapter|Vol. 2}}<ref name="nis staff"/> She enjoys food, having once made a whole tub of pudding,{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 1}} and teaming up with Taiga as a struggling "diet soldier".{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 18}} She is capable in cooking and cleaning as a result of her part-time jobs as well as taking care of her little brother while both her parents work.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 34, 38}} She is fascinated by ghosts and hopes to meet one someday, and one time, she opens up with her feelings about love to Ryuji. {{Ref|Chapter|Vol. 6}}

Yusaku wears glasses, and has a diligent personality.<ref name="nis staff"/> Although he thinks he is poor at talking to girls, Ryuji observes that Yusaku is actually quite popular with them.{{Ref|Chapter|Vol. 1}} When Taiga confesses to him, he reveals that he had actually confessed to Taiga a year prior because she was so beautiful, but was rejected.{{Ref|Chapter|Vol. 2}} While not buried in student council activities, Yusaku exhibits an eccentric personality as demonstrated in a bonus chapter where he plays the President card game without any clue of the rules,{{Ref|Chapter|Vol. 4}} and a summer trip story where he wears just a towel around and randomly flashed the girls.{{Ref|Chapter|Vol. 5}} In a later storyline, it is revealed he had a crush on the student council president Sumire Kanō, but got so depressed over her departure that he bleached his hair.{{Ref|Chapter|Vol. 7}} His nickname is "Maruo".{{Ref|Chapter|Vol. 6, 7}}
<!-- NEED SOURCE AND RELEVANCE
:A running gag in the series is that he often appears around Taiga and Ryuji while they are discussing a "plan of attack" to get closer to their crushes. Like Minori, he has an unusual personality, but often it is an expression of his friendship and appreciation, though it can easily get out of hand fast. Like Ami, he is unusually perceptive of what is going on around him and know people for they truly are deep down, though unlike his childhood friend, he prefers to have things run on their own instead of actively intervening in others' affairs despite his curiosity. After his graduation, he goes to study abroad in America, following in Sumire Kanō's footsteps.
